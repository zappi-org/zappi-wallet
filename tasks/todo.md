# Current Task — ZAP-81

- [x] Confirm wallet repo rules (`CLAUDE.md`, root `AGENTS.md`, `zappi-wallet/AGENTS.md`) and review `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] Re-check current branch / worktree status and session diff
- [x] Commit ZAP-52/ZAP-253 follow-up work (`f6273ab`, `fix: harden incoming review resolution`)
- [x] Commit ZAP-235 follow-up work (`8d22262`, `fix: prevent duplicate mint names`)
- [x] Commit ZAP-44 follow-up work (`a97cb52`, `feat: support mint and relay ordering`)
- [x] Commit ZAP-233 follow-up work (`069acb1`, `feat: allow force deleting mints`)
- [x] Re-prioritize remaining `월렛 알파 준비` issues again and pick the next concrete item (`ZAP-81`)
- [x] Inspect `SwapService` drain retry flow and confirm where abandoned mint quotes remain pending in Coco
- [x] Add a swap-quote cleanup hook so composition can abandon orphan target quotes through the Cashu layer
- [x] Update drain retry flow to abandon replaced quotes and cancel their receive-completion waits before re-quoting
- [x] Cover both successful drain retry cleanup and early drain budget failure cleanup with focused regression tests
- [x] Run targeted validation for ZAP-81 changes

Review
- Current implementation branch is `fix/zap-81-drain-quote-cleanup`, stacked on top of committed ZAP-233 work from `fix/zap-233-force-delete-mint`.
- `ZAP-81` is the next low-risk wallet-alpha cleanup item because the issue is tightly scoped to drain retry behavior inside `SwapService`, and the existing `SwapQuoteMarker` port already provided the correct composition seam.
- The root problem was that drain mode only called `unmark()` when replacing the first receive quote, so Coco still kept the old mint quote and mint operation pending until invoice expiry.
- `SwapQuoteMarker` still provides `abandon(accountId, quoteId)`, but the Cashu composition now maps that to an atomic Coco cleanup helper that directly deletes the abandoned mint quote row and its linked mint operations instead of overloading the quote state with `ISSUED`.
- `SwapService` now treats cleanup as part of the drain retry contract: it abandons the superseded quote before creating a replacement quote, cancels the stale `onReceiveCompleted` subscription/timeout, and fails fast if cleanup cannot complete.
- Early drain-budget exits preserve their original failure reason and append cleanup detail only when abandonment itself fails, so the retry path no longer hides the underlying balance/drain cause.
- Quote cleanup tracking is now quote-scoped, so if a later replacement quote fails before `executeSend`, the newest quote is still cleaned up rather than being left marked/pending.
- Full verification is now documented per `tasks/lessons.md`: `bun run lint`, `bun run build`, `bun run test`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, rule audit against `CLAUDE.md` + both `AGENTS.md` files + `tasks/lessons.md`, `git diff --check`, and `verify-*` status check (`rg --files | rg '(^|/)verify-'` returned no matches in this workspace).
- Design and review were both re-run with specialist agents after the rework; the final rule-audit review found no remaining rule violations in the touched files.
- Full build passed after fixing a `swap.service.test.ts` mock typing regression caught by `tsc -b`; build still emits the existing Vite chunk-size warnings, but no new build failures were introduced by the ZAP-81 changes.
- Next likely investigation track remains `ZAP-238`, unless fresh local repro points to a more urgent wallet-alpha blocker.

# Zappi Wallet — Design Overhaul

- [x] aria-label "Back"/"Close" 하드코딩 → i18n
- [x] bounce-slow → float-slow (smooth easing)

## Phase 2: Arrange (Home 위계) ✅
- [x] 잔액 영역 — "Total" 라벨 축소, 숫자 주인공, baseline 정렬
- [x] 카루셀 간격 축소 (pt-10 pb-8 → pt-6 pb-6)
- [x] 액션 버튼 그림자 정리

## Phase 3: Distill (Settings 구조) ✅
